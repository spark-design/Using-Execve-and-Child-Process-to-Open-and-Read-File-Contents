# Using-Execve-and-Child-Process-to-Open-and-Read-File-Contents
myRand creates a file with 60 random ints 0-100 and names the file "dataX.dat" it exits with exit(X). dataRead forks a child process 
to run myRand, look at the X exit file to find the name of the file (dataX.dat), and uses execve to open the file and find the average
of all of the numbers from the file
